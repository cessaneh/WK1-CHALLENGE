 ## Description
Challenge 1:Student Grade Generator

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  49 to 59, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

I used the if and else if statements and gave conditions to the functions.I created a HTML file so that i'm able to prompt the grade.


Challenge 2: Speed Detector

Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

if the speed is 80, it should print 2 points and  if the points exceed 12 the function should print license suspended.

we use if and else if statements to be able to return the number of demerit points.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator 
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

we calculated the  NSSF and NHIF deductions.Net salary and gross salry are in one function
